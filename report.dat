HW5 Documentation


The homework should be run in two seperate processes. You need to run main first in order to create the pipes, then you run mem.

The program will simply work as the hw doc indicated. Just make sure you run main before mem. 

Please do "make clean" after every time you run it. 

Please be lenient :) thank you!
